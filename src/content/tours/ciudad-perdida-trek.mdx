Embark on the adventure of a lifetime with our 4-day Ciudad Perdida trek. Walk in the footsteps of the ancient Teyuna civilization through pristine jungle, cross crystal-clear rivers, and discover archaeological terraces that predate Machu Picchu by 650 years.

This challenging but rewarding journey takes you deep into the Sierra Nevada mountains, home to indigenous communities who still maintain their ancestral traditions. Sleep under the stars, wake to howler monkey calls, and experience Colombia's most authentic adventure.
